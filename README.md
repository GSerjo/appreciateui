============

AppreciateUI is the ideal tool for gathering inspiration when designing a mobile user interface. Screenshots from hundreds of apps all within the palm of your hand. Browse the latest designs added weekly, or view by category to find just the design to inspire your own creation. After you've found the right one, add it to your in-app collection for reference!

Web Inteface
-----------

In addition to the native mobile application, a web inteface was created that mirrored the native app. The source is also
public and can be found here: [appreciateui-web](https://github.com/thedillonb/appreciateui-web).
